# Project Progress Log - Interactive Map with Shapefiles

## Project Overview
- **Objective**: Create an interactive map in Vue.js using Indian shapefiles
- **Mapping Library**: Leaflet.js
- **Data Source**: IND_adm2 and IND_WHOLE shapefiles
- **Future Features**: Display instruments on map with popup modals showing full information via API calls

## Requirements Confirmed
1. **Project Structure**: Vue.js project in subdirectory
2. **Shapefile Processing**: Convert shapefiles to GeoJSON using Python (separate directory)
3. **Map Features**: Interactive features (zoom, pan, click events), instrument icons with popup modals
4. **Styling**: Realistic appearance
5. **Development Environment**: Complete development environment with build tools for API integration

## Actions Completed
- [2025-08-08] Created did.md file to track progress
- [2025-08-08] Analyzed available shapefiles (IND_adm2.*, IND_WHOLE.*)
- [2025-08-08] Created complete Python development environment with virtual environment
- [2025-08-08] Created Python shapefile converter application with the following features:
  - Virtual environment setup with setup.bat
  - Requirements management
  - Development tools (dev.py)
  - Successfully converted IND_adm2.shp to GeoJSON (667 features - district level)
  - Successfully converted IND_WHOLE.shp to GeoJSON (37 features - state level)
  - Generated metadata.json with conversion information
  - Both files are in EPSG:4326 coordinate system (perfect for web mapping)
- [2025-08-08] Vue.js approach had compatibility issues - switched to Python Flask web application
- [2025-08-08] ‚úÖ Created complete Python Flask web application with interactive map:
  - Flask web server with RESTful API endpoints
  - HTML5 responsive interface with Leaflet.js
  - Interactive map with India boundaries
  - Multiple map styles (Satellite, Streets, Topographic, OSM)
  - Layer controls for states/districts toggle
  - Click/hover interactions with popup information
  - Map bounds restricted to India only (cropped world view)
  - Reset view button to return to India bounds
  - Error handling and responsive design
  - Virtual environment setup with setup.bat

## Current Status
- Python shapefile converter: ‚úÖ Complete and working
- Vue.js application: ‚ùå Removed due to compatibility issues
- Python Flask web application: ‚úÖ Complete and running at http://localhost:5000

## Key Features Implemented
- ‚úÖ Interactive India map with restricted bounds (world cropped to India)
- ‚úÖ 37 state/UT boundaries with hover/click interactions
- ‚úÖ 667 district boundaries with detailed information
- ‚úÖ Multiple map styles for realistic appearance
- ‚úÖ RESTful API for GeoJSON data serving
- ‚úÖ Responsive design for desktop and mobile
- ‚úÖ Ready for instrument marker integration

## Next Steps
1. ‚úÖ Create Python application for shapefile to GeoJSON conversion
2. ‚úÖ Create Python Flask web application with HTML/CSS/JS for interactive map
3. ‚úÖ Implement Leaflet.js with India-only bounds (cropped view)
4. üîÑ Add interactive features and prepare for instrument display functionality
