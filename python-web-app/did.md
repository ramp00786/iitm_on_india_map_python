# Project Work Log - Python Web App Map Icons Implementation

## Task Understanding
- **Requirement**: Implement site and instrument icons in the `python-web-app` map similar to how they appear in the `india_map_instruments` Laravel project
- **Hindi Prompt Translation**: "Just like icons for sites and instruments are visible on the 'india_map_instruments' map, similar icons should also be visible in the 'python-web-app'"

## Analysis Completed (Date: 2025-08-11)

### What I Found:
1. **Laravel Project (`india_map_instruments`)**:
   - Has fully functional site and instrument markers using Leaflet.js
   - Uses custom icons with different colors for different statuses
   - Has API endpoints providing structured data
   - Implements toggle controls for showing/hiding markers
   - Has detailed popups with site/instrument information

2. **Python Web App**:
   - Already has Leaflet.js integration
   - Has API endpoint `/api/projects` that fetches data from Laravel API
   - Has site and instrument layer functionality implemented in `map.js`
   - Has toggle controls in the HTML
   - But may have issues with proper icon display or data fetching

### Current Status:
- The Python web app already has most of the required functionality implemented
- The issue might be with data fetching, icon creation, or API connectivity

### Next Steps Needed:
1. Test the current Python web app to see what's working/not working
2. Check if the Laravel API is running and accessible
3. Verify data fetching from `/api/projects` endpoint
4. Ensure proper icon display for sites and instruments
5. Test toggle functionality for showing/hiding markers

## Actions Taken:
- [2025-08-11] Created this did.md file to track work progress
- [2025-08-11] Analyzed both projects to understand current implementation
- [2025-08-11] Tested Python web app - it's running successfully at http://localhost:5000
- [2025-08-11] Verified Laravel API is accessible and returning data with sites
- [2025-08-11] Found that Python app API endpoint `/api/projects` is working and fetching data from Laravel

## Current Status Summary:
- ✅ Laravel API running on port 8000 and returning site data with icons
- ✅ Python Flask app running on port 5000
- ✅ Python app successfully fetching data from Laravel API
- ✅ Site icons are present in the data (base64 encoded)
- ❓ Need to check if icons are being displayed properly on the map

## Next Steps:
1. Test if site icons are visible on the Python web app map
2. Compare icon display between Laravel and Python implementations
3. Fix any icon display issues
4. Ensure instrument markers also work properly
